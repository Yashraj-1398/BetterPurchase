The BetterPurchase project also involved designing a robust database structure, represented through ER (Entity-Relationship) diagrams. These diagrams were crucial in modeling the relationships between various entities such as products, retailers (Amazon, Walmart, Apple, etc.), and their attributes (price, category, specifications, etc.). The project began with an initial ER diagram, which represented the database structure before normalization. The database was then normalized to optimize performance, eliminate redundancy, and ensure data integrity. The final ER diagram reflects the normalized structure, reducing unnecessary duplication and improving the efficiency of queries.
The implementation was done using SQL to handle database structures and queries, while Python was used for automating data insertion and auditing processes. Python scripts inserted product data into MySQL tables, running SQL queries to structure and manage the data effectively from retailers such as Walmart, Apple, and others. The project also involved auditing the database to ensure data completeness, validity, and consistency, utilizing Python for verification tasks. This combination of SQL and Python ensured smooth data handling, automated updates, and allowed users to query accurate, real-time data from various eCommerce platforms, including Apple and Walmart, offering customers the best deals available.
